Making it worse is your lack of time to spend with your wife Julia as well as the opportunistic nature of your advisors. Eventually, they take all the power.

You are left with just tearful sobbing every night. Perhaps your advisors were right, when they said the Presidency was a poisoned chalice and losing was the better option.  ";
