As your dictatorship begins, you begin to trust close advisors too much and thus the Nation is under a lot of stress economically. Making it worse is your lack of time to spend with your wife Julia as well as the opportunistic nature of your advisors. Eventually, they take all the power. So you begin to drink even more heavily, feeling like you lack a sense of power. You occasionally even protest your treatment, but it all fails. You say get me out of here, but that fails too. You are left with just tearful sobbing every night. Perhaps your advisors were right, when they said the Presidency was a poisoned chalice and losing was the better option.  ";
